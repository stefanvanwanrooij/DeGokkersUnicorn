 # GokkersProject
------------------

This is a project we did for our school, we had to make a website to download a game we made earlier on.


-----------------
 Getting started
-----------------

To get working on this project you'll need to have some sort of webserver installed on your local machine. 
You'll also need a text editor (preferably something along the lines of Sublime Text) to edit the html and php files.
